# SynergyForge
*Data-driven team building for strategy gamers.*

**SynergyForge** is a tactical team analysis tool designed for strategy games like *Marvel Strike Force*.  
It calculates **team synergy scores**, visualizes **turn order speed tuning**, and maps **counter strategies** â€” making it an invaluable tool for both casual players and competitive strategists.

This version has been rebuilt from the ground up to serve two purposes:
1. **Portfolio Showcase** â€“ A polished, professional-grade application to demonstrate data analysis, UI design, and full-stack development skills.
2. **Monetizable Product** â€“ Donation links and potential subscription features for revenue generation.
